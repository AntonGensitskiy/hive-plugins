Hive Import
===========

Hive Import Action executes a hive load statement which loads data from HDFS directory/file location into a hive table.

Usage Notes
-----------

Hive Import Action imports data from HDFS by executing provided Hive [Load Statement](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/GettingStarted). 
Local file storage is not allowed because a pipeline can run on any machine. If `LOCAL` file storage option is provided,
pipeline deployment fails at publish time. Hive Import only accepts hive `LOAD` statements. If any other hive query is provided,
pipeline publish will fail. 

If the Load command is executed successfully, all the files in the directory will be moved, not copied, to hive/warehouse directory. Hive import works with Hive 1.2.1.
